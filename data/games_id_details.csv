Table Items
Since poker is a game typically played by adults, we have adult themes for the items that are available for the player to equip on the table. For example, weapons can be brandished at the table and the player's avatar is able to interact with it such as picking up brass knuckles, knife or a gun. The avatar will also pick up drink items, such as drinking from a beer bottle or shot glass. There are no applied affects, such as the avatar getting drunk from drinking. The avatar can also pick up a cigar or cigarette and ""take a drag"" from it. Most of these interactions are random, the player cannot initiate it.

Avatars
No Avatars are ever fighting with each other in any physical way. There are ways for the player to express themselves though emotes, such as a chip trick, a throat slit hand motion, happy dance but none of them have any displays of blood, gore or any other mature content.

Environments
The overall theme of the game is playing Poker in a city called Prominence. There are some allusions to legally and illegally playing poker with the ""Affiliations."" The player picks an affiliation and gets rewards for leveling them up but not for doing any legal or illegal activities.

The Laundromat has some implied drug trafficking through open boxes with non-descript packages in them. The player again, cannot interact with this, there is no dialogue calling it out, it's purely visual.

Motherland Meats is a meat packaging facility that has the most direct display of mature content. There are clean hanging pig corpses in the freezer, a human-shaped bag in the freezer, some dried blood splatters, and NPCs that are working in the background. There is no in-your-face gore, actively dripping or spilling blood.
